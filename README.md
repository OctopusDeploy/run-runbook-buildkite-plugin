# Run Runbook Buildkite Plugin

This is a Buildkite plugin to run a runbook in [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/). 

**This plugin requires [Octopus CLI](https://octopus.com/downloads/octopuscli) to be installed on the Buildkite agent.**

## Runbooks in Octopus Deploy

Runbooks automate routine maintenance and emergency operations tasks, such as infrastructure provisioning, database management, and website failover and restoration. Runbooks include all the necessary permissions for the infrastructure they run on, so anybody on the team can execute the runbook, and because they're managed in Octopus there's a complete audit trail. Runbooks can be parameterized with prompted variables so that human interaction is required.

## Examples

Incorporate the following step in your `pipeline.yml` to create a release in Octopus Deploy:

**NOTE: These examples configure the Octopus server and API Key environment variables in the `pipeline.yml` file, this is NOT recommended and these should be configured as environment variables on the Buildkite agent.**

### Basic examples

**Run a runbook using the published snapshot**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Run runbook in Octopus Deploy üêô
    env:
      OCTOPUS_CLI_SERVER: 'https://octopus.url'
      OCTOPUS_CLI_API_KEY: 'API-xxxxxx'
    plugins: 
      - OctopusDeploy/run-runbook@<version>
        runbook: 'Greeting'
        project: 'HelloWorld'
        environments: 'Test'
```

**Run a runbook using a specific snapshot**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Run runbook in Octopus Deploy üêô
    env:
      OCTOPUS_CLI_SERVER: 'https://octopus.url'
      OCTOPUS_CLI_API_KEY: 'API-xxxxxx'
    plugins: 
      - OctopusDeploy/run-runbook@<version>
        runbook: 'Greeting'
        project: 'HelloWorld'
        environments: 'Test'
        snapshot: 'KGHSL3L'
```

**Run a runbook in multiple environments**

```yml
steps:
  - label: Run a runbook in Octopus Deploy üêô
    env:
      OCTOPUS_CLI_SERVER: 'https://octopus.url'
      OCTOPUS_CLI_API_KEY: 'API-xxxxxx'
    plugins: 
      - OctopusDeploy/run-runbook@<version>

        project: 'HelloWorld'
        environments:
